Algorithms And Data Structures
==============================

Some labbing with algorithms and data structure implementation in C.

To build:

    make

To cross-compile for e.g. AVR:

    make CROSS_COMPILE=avr- MACH=atmega328

To test:

    make test

Coverage output is saved in $(OUTDIR)/gcov.

To profile:

    make profile

Profiling output is saved in $(OUTDIR)/profile.log.

To clean:

    make clean
